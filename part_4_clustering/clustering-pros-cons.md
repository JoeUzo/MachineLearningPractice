| Clustering Model        | Pros                                                                                       | Cons                                     |

| **K-Means**             | Simple to understand, easily adaptable, works well on small or large datasets, fast, efficient and performant | Need to choose the number of clusters   |
| **Hierarchical Clustering** | The optimal number of clusters can be obtained by the model itself, practical visualization with the dendrogram | Not appropriate for large datasets       |
