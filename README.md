# Machine Learning Practice

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Practice** repository! This project serves as a collection of exercises, notes, and implementations from the machine learning course I am currently taking on Udemy. As I progress, I will be updating this repository with more examples, models, and insights.

## Contents
- [K-Means Clustering](./clustering/Kmeans-clustering/)
- [Hierarchical Clustering](./clustering/hierarchical-clustering/)
- More topics coming soon!

## About
This repository is a work-in-progress and reflects my journey through learning machine learning concepts. It includes:
- Practical implementations of machine learning algorithms.
- Notes and explanations to reinforce learning.
- Example datasets used for practice.

## Credit
The material and inspiration for this repository come from the Udemy course [Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/). A big thanks to the course instructors for their detailed explanations and hands-on approach.

## How to Use
Feel free to explore the code and notes in this repository. Clone the repo using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoeUzo/MachineLearningPractice.git
```

## Contributing
This is primarily for personal learning, but suggestions and improvements are welcome. Please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Future Plans
- Add more algorithms and techniques.
- Include detailed explanations and visualizations.
- Explore advanced topics like neural networks and deep learning.

Stay tuned for updates as I continue to expand this repository!
